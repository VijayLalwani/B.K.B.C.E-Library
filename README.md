# B.K.B.C.E-Library

The purpose of this project is to make the library management more simple as of now days everything is done on computers from typing letters to taking man in space. So why to still use papers and cards to manage library when it can be done on computer and can be much simpler. This application can issue/return books, keep the information of all 15000 books and can do a lot more which will be described further. If more time was available there could be many more changes done to this project.
